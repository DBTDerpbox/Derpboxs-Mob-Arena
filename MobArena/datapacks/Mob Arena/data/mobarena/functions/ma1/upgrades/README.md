Welcome to the Upgrades system for Mob Arena.

Actual decent documentation coming Soonâ„¢

Mainly using this to put down notes I need

## Notes

`Scores!`

This is the place I need to remember to put things in for stuff like score resets and such regarding upgrades

```
MobArena/datapacks/Mob Arena/data/mobarena/functions/ma1/eliminate/scores.mcfunction

MobArena/datapacks/Mob Arena/data/mobarena/functions/ma1/setup/scores.mcfunction

MobArena/datapacks/Mob Arena/data/mobarena/functions/ma1/upgrades/runner.mcfunction
```

Oh yeah, we're most likely scrapping the Armor page, upgrading armor seems way too overpowered from testing.

### Notices

There are still a lot of issues with this system! It's a work in process that im just too busy to deal with currently.. Hopefully ill clean it up soon
